# EasySoundBoard
	A program for playing audio in an input device.

	To use the application you need to have a virtual audio cable driver
	I recommend https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/

# File format
	At the moment, only one file format is available, it is MP3. In the future. 
	It is planned to add a large number of formats.
